(NOTE: This repository contains a modified version of Mujoco_RL_UR5 repository, link:https://github.com/PaulDanielML/MuJoCo_RL_UR5.git. The credit for developing the framework is given to owner PaulDanielML. However, since making it open source and provision of a license to anyone on the repository, my repository contains the implementation with modifications to the code along with implementation in a docker container for easy portability. The modifications are mentioned below.)
# VisualRL_Grasper (In Progress)
Reinforcement Learning algorithm on Mujoco based robotic arm for object picking using Visual input.
This repository contains a project on utilising Mujoco based gym environment of a robotic arm UR5 and training the arm to grasp different solid objects from a vision based input to the algorithms. The observation space is a camera input from top-view of workspace with objects to grasp.
Further information added gradually.
